**SnappyCart** is a modern, headless React cart system designed for plug-and-play use in any React app. With full support for local state and future SaaS syncing, it's the perfect cart foundation - open-source and Pro-ready.

---

## Why SnappyCart?

Most cart solutions are either too basic or too opinionated.
SnappyCart gives you the core cart engine and UI building blocks, so you can ship your own cart UX without fighting a framework.

- **Headless by default:** bring your own UI, or use the included drawer and components.
- **Type-safe:** first-class TypeScript types, predictable APIs, fewer runtime surprises.
- **Composable:** works with any React app architecture, from tiny SPAs to serious storefronts.
- **Built for growth:** structured to support future sync, analytics, and checkout flows without rewrites.

## Features

- Cart primitives: `add`, `remove`, `updateQuantity`, `clear`
- React context + hook: `CartProvider`, `useCart`
- Optional UI: sliding cart drawer you can theme
- Persistence: localStorage support out of the box
- Works with any product model (you own the schema)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install snappycart
```

## Quick Start
**1. Wrap your app once:**
```javascript
import { CartProvider } from "snappycart";

export function App() {
  return (
    <CartProvider>
      {/* your app */}
    </CartProvider>
  );
}
```

**2. Use the hook anywhere:**
```tsx
import { useCart } from "snappycart";

export function AddToCartButton() {
  const { addItem } = useCart();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        addItem({
          id: "sku_123",
          name: "Coffee Beans",
          price: 1299,
          quantity: 1,
        })
      }
    >
      Add to cart
    </button>
  );
}
```
**3. Open the cart UI (if you use the provided drawer):**
```tsx
import { useCart } from "snappycart";

export function CartButton() {
  const { openCart, itemsCount } = useCart();
  return <button onClick={openCart}>Cart ({itemsCount})</button>;
}
```
